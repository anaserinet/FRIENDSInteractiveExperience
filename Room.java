/**
 * Class Room - a room in a game.
 *
 * This class is part of the "FRIENDS: An Interactive Videogame" application. 
 * "FRIENDS: An Interactive Videogame" is an application based on the TV show "Friends".   
 * 
 * A "Room" can be of 2 types: 
 * -Normal Room-: A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is 
 *   connected to other rooms via exits.  For each existing exit, the room 
 *   stores a reference to the neighboring room.
 * -Random Room--:  A special type of room that initially exists as a placeholder 
 *   but transforms into a randomly chosen normal room during gameplay.
 * 
 * Each "Room" can have the following:
 * - Exits: Links to other rooms, mapped by directions (ex: "north" or "west").
 * - Items: Objects the player can interact with or collect (Items is a separate class).
 * - Characters: NPCs that may inhabit the room.
 * - Attributes: Descriptions and other unique identifiers (ex: type of room).
 *
