/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "FRIENDS: An Interactive Videogame" application based on the TV show "Friends".  
 *  Users can:
 *  - walk around the Friends basic set. (13 rooms)
 *  - interact with items in the rooms (grabbing and dropping items)
 *  - interact with the main characters of the series (talking to them)
 *  The game consists of completing tasks and collecting enough money to "save central perk from closing down"
 * Each task has a certain amount of subtasks that you have to complete that involve different rooms, items and characters
 *  
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class:
 *  - Creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  
 *  - Evaluates and executes the commands that the parser returns.
 *  - Prints all of the what needs to be displayed to the terminal
 *
